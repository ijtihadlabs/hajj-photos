# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing.

## Project principles (must follow)

- No backend / servers
- No accounts / login
- No tracking / analytics
- No scraping Nusuk
- Keep the app private, local-only and offline-friendly
- Prefer simple, reliable UX over complex AI features

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Keep PRs small and focused
4. Include a short description and screenshots if UI changes
5. Avoid adding large dependencies unless necessary

## Build and checks

- Builds must pass: `npm run build`
- Keep UI readable in light/dark mode
- Do not commit generated build artifacts
